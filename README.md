# chess_engine
Chess engine written in Haskell as an academic project.

This file will be updates as I will develop the whole project. Chess engine will be my first application realized in functional programming language.


# Compilation

To compile you should use:

ghc <moduleName>

For example:

ghc TreeBuilding.hs


# Progress

At the moment project contains:

- piece, square and board representation,
- some functions which help with moving the pieces
- a function showing all possible moves,
- modular division.
 
 All of that will need some refactoring as soon as I will get better knowledge of Haskell :).
