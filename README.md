# chess_engine
Chess engine written in Haskell as an academic project.

This file will be updates as I will develop the whole project. Chess engine will be my first application realized in functional programming language. I hope it will be succesfull :).

# Progress

At the moment project contains:

- piece, square and board representation,
- some functions which help with moving the pieces
- a function showing all possible moves.
 
 All of that will need some refactoring as soon as I will get better knowledge of Haskell :).
